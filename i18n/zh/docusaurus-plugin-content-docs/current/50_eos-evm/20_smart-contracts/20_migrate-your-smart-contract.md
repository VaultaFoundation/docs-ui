title: Migrate your Smart Contract
---

This guide will teach you to deploy a smart contract to the EOS EVM using hardhat on both the EOS EVM mainnet and testnet.

## Set up your MetaMask

You can add the EOS EVM Testnet network to your MetaMask in one click with [**Chainlist**](https://chainlist.org/?search=EOS&testnets=true).

Just select the network you want to use, and click the **Connect Wallet** button.

Any of your existing Ethereum addresses will work on the EOS EVM, so you can use the same wallet you use for Ethereum
or any other EVM compatible chain.

## Getting EOS tokens

If you're on the testnet, you can get some EOS tokens using the [**testnet faucet**](https://faucet.testnet.evm.eosnetwork.com/).

If you're on the mainnet, you will need to purchase some EOS tokens from an exchange. There is no difference between EOS 
on the EVM and EOS on the EOS Network. They are the same token, and can be used interchangeably. Once you have some EOS tokens, you can transfer them to your EOS EVM address using a standard EOS transfer.
- Send tokens to: `eosio.evm`
- Set the `memo` to your EOS EVM address

The `eosio.evm` contract will then forward the tokens you sent to your EOS EVM address.

## Hardhat configuration

If you want to set up a new hardhat project, head over to their [quick start](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#quick-start)
guide.


Open up your `hardhat.config.js` file and add the following configuration:


```javascript
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
    // ...

    networks: {
        eosevm: {
            url: "https://api.evm.eosnetwork.com",
            accounts:[process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
        },
        eosevm_testnet: {
            url: "https://api.testnet.evm.eosnetwork.com",
            accounts:[process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
        }
    }
};
```

> ðŸ”‘ **Private Keys**
> 
> Note that we are using `process.env.PRIVATE_KEY` to make sure that our private key isn't exposed in our code.
> This means you need to be using either something like `dotenv` to inject the key into your environment,
> add it manually to your environment, or you can just replace the environment variable with your private key directly.
> 
> However, be careful putting your actual key into this file, as it may be committed to a public repository,
> and you should NEVER share your private key with anyone.

## Deploying your contract

Now you can deploy your contract to the EOS EVM testnet:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network eosevm

// or for testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network eosevm_testnet
```

Once deployed, you will see the address of your new contract, and can view it an explorer by pasting it 
into the search field.

- [**Testnet Explorer**](https://explorer.testnet.evm.eosnetwork.com/)
- [**Mainnet Explorer**](https://explorer.evm.eosnetwork.com/)

## Congratulations!

You have successfully deployed your first smart contract to the EOS EVM! ðŸŽ‰

If you already have a front-end application that interacts with your smart contract, you can now point it at the 
[EOS EVM Endpoints](./10_endpoints.md) and it will work as expected.

Make sure you visit the [**Compatibility**](../30_compatibility/index.md) section to learn about the differences between
the EOS EVM and Ethereum, and how to make sure your web3 application works on the EOS EVM as expected.
