title: What is EOS EVM
---

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the computing environment native to the Ethereum Network. EOS EVM is the computing environment that enables developers to create and deploy decentralized applications on the EOS blockchain. With EOS EVM, developers can create smart contracts using the Solidity programming language, which is the same language used for Ethereum smart contracts. This makes it easier for developers to port their existing Ethereum applications to the EOS blockchain, or to create new applications that can be deployed on both Ethereum and EOS.

Overall, EOS EVM provides developers with an easy and flexible way to build decentralized applications on a high-performance blockchain platform.

The EVM support brings the following advantages:

* It connects the EOS and the Ethereum ecosystems.
* EOS can leverage well developed applications that already exist.
* The Solidity language and the numerous existing libraries can significantly increase the number of smart contract developers and applications on EOS.
* The Solidity developers and applications will benefit from the EOS EVM low gas cost, high performance, good finality, and time-tested stability of the EOS blockchain, in contrast with the other EVM-based chains.
* EOS EVM works with almost all wallets and development tools. Simply configure them to connect to the EOS EVM and you can start experiment with solidity smart contracts.
