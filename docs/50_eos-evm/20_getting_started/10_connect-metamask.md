title: How To Connect MetaMask

## The EOS EVM Bridge Way

To quickly set up your MetaMask wallet you can visit the EOS EVM Bridge application and connect your wallet. You will then be led through a process that adds the EOS EVM network to your MetaMask automatically.

- [Mainnet](https://bridge.evm.eosnetwork.com/)
- [Testnet](https://bridge.testnet.evm.eosnetwork.com/)

## The Step by Step Way

Alternatively, to manually add the EOS EVM network to your MetaMask wallet follow the steps below:

1. Open the MetaMask wallet and click on the network in the top center:

The EOS EVM Network Mainnet connection details are as follows:

* `Network Name`: EOS EVM Network
* `Chain ID`: 17777
* `New RPC URL`: https://api.evm.eosnetwork.com/
* `Currency Symbol`: EOS
* `Block Explorer URL (Optional)`: https://explorer.evm.eosnetwork.com/
* `Token Bridge`: https://bridge.evm.eosnetwork.com/

The EOS EVM Network Testnet Preview connection details are as follows:

* `Network Name`: EOS EVM Network Testnet
* `Chain ID`: 15557
* `New RPC URL`: https://api.testnet.evm.eosnetwork.com/
* `Currency Symbol`: EOS
* `Block Explorer URL (Optional)`: https://explorer.testnet.evm.eosnetwork.com/
* `Token Bridge`: https://bridge.testnet.evm.eosnetwork.com/

Alternative endpoints can be found in the [helpful links](../60_helpful_links.md) section.

Yet another way is to find the network you want to connect to at [Chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/), and you can add the configuration to your wallet through that service.
